    <h2>ISAC 2.0 Documentation</h2>
    <p>This bot is responsible for tracking players in the game Tom Clancy's The Division2 or Division2.</p>
    <p>It responds to the command:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Initially you might find yourself lose, no worries, just give it a try, run: <code>/dth</code></p>
    <p><img src="image.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>This is the bot replying to you and telling you that you use run: <code>/dth help</code>, as it requires a sub
        commmand from the &quot;dth&quot; stack.</p>
    <h3>1. The Helper</h3>
    <p><code>/dth help</code> command, provides you with everything you need to know to get yourself started. It will
        showcase every command available to you.</p>
    <p><img src="image-1.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>2. About</h3>
    <p><code>/dth about</code> command provides you with information on who buiilt the system and what tech stack the
        system
        uses.</p>
    <p><img src="image-2.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>3. FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h3>
    <p><code>/dth faq</code> command provides a convenient way to list information about ISAC, what people are curious
        about, the rules and more. Its contents are frequently updated so the image below, might not reflect it's
        current
        state.</p>
    <p><img src="image-3.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>4. Active Players</h3>
    <p><code>/dth active-players</code> is a command which outputs a rough estimate of active players, based on local
        data.
        It's not accurate, we know, but, it's the closest thing you got for Division2, in terms of online players.</p>
    <p><img src="image-4.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>5. Username Check</h3>
    <p><code>/dth username-check &lt;insert-platform&gt; &lt;insert-username&gt;</code> provides you with an easy way to
        see
        if the username you want to change to is available or not. As a general idea, the platform can take 3 values:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>pc:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-5.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <ul>
        <li>psn (Playstation Network)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-6.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <ul>
        <li>xbox</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-7.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>6. Subscription</h3>
    <p><code>/dth subscription</code> will display subscription information related to ISAC. As a general idea, ISAC is
        free
        to use in it's official discord. But, in order to use it in a private server, you will have to have an active
        trial
        or subscription.</p>
    <p>This command can be ran in 2 places:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>DMs (ISAC is indeed DMable) -&gt; displays your user subscription info</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-8.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Server -&gt; Displays Server Subscription info</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-9.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>7. Daily Loot</h3>
    <p><code>/dth daily-loot</code> command, will showcase today's targeted loot.</p>
    <p><img src="image-10.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>7. Analyze</h3>
    <p><code>/dth analyze</code> is a command which attempts to use local data in order to perform static analysis
        between
        username changes. In pther words, every time someone changes name, their account information is logged and it's
        bound together by something called <code>uplay id</code>. This ID is unique and cannot be change. It's what
        allows
        the system to store username changes and bind data. Leaving this explanation asside, we can use the account
        snapshots to calculate differences in between them. The command can be used in 2 pars:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth analyze &lt;insert-player-here&gt;</code>, this will run it on a given player.</li>
        <li><code>/dth analyze me</code>, this will analyze it for youself, assuming you have an ISAC Profile
            registered.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Self Analysis:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-11.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Player Analysis:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-12.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>8. Compare</h3>
    <p><code>/dth compare &lt;insert-first-username&gt; &lt;insert-second-username&gt;</code> will atempt to compare 2
        accounts, calculate a score and simply determine which score is higher. The score consists of headshots,
        bodyshots
        and crits. Of course, headshots have a 0.2 modified, since they require more skill. Example:</p>
    <p><img src="image-13.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>9. Generate Password</h3>
    <p><code>/dth generate-password</code> is a handy command which generates Ubisoft Compliant secure passwords. (WE DO
        NOT
        STORE ANYTHING, the bot doesn't know if you chose a password or not). The command accepts one single argument
        which
        is optional, that is, password length. By default, Ubisoft requires a password which contains a maximum of 16
        characters. You can generate a password with a length with up to 30. <code>/dth generate-password 30</code>.
        Example:</p>
    <p><img src="image-14.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>As you can see it generates an extremely secure password that is almost impossible to crack and is Ubisoft
        Compliant.
    </p>
    <h3>10. Generate Username</h3>
    <p><code>/dth generate-username</code> will attempt to randomly generate a list of 16 usernames, by default. You may
        generate a maximum of 30 per execution by doing <code>/dth generate-username 30</code>. Example:</p>
    <p><img src="image-15.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>11. User Merits</h3>
    <p><code>/dth user-merits</code> is a command that showcases ISAC's merit system. The system has 2 types of merits:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Automatic / Auto-Assigned based on player stats</li>
        <li>Manual / Custom (Assigned by Staff Members)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In terms of custom merits, you will see &quot;Cheater Companion or Cybersherlock&quot;, the most predominant
        ones.
    </p>
    <p>It's important to explain that ISAC's merit system is found on every ISAC profile, right under
        <code>Listed Merits</code>
    </p>
    <p><img src="image-16.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Running <code>/dth user-merits</code> will output:</p>
    <p><img src="image-17.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>12. Registration</h3>
    <p><code>/dth register -u &lt;insert-username&gt; -p &lt;insert-platform&gt; -n &lt;insert-nickname&gt;</code>, will
        enable you to create an ISAC profile, which is bound to your Discord Account. This will enable you to track
        yourself
        and perform self-analysis. Here's how you can use it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Run <code>/dth register help</code> first, to see the helper:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-18.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Based on the helper, you can see it requires some things, in order to work. Let's break it down together:
        </li>
        <li><code>-u &lt;insert-username&gt;</code>, requests your in-game username</li>
        <li><code>-p &lt;insert-platform&gt;</code>, requests your platform. This can take one of the following values:
            <code>uplay</code> for pc, <code>psn</code> for PlayStation and <code>xbox</code> for XBOX Live.
        </li>
        <li><code>-n &lt;insert-nickname&gt;</code>, requests your nickname. You can set any nickname you want.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What's important as well is that, you can create 3 profiles. One for every platform.</p>
    <p>Now, let's try an example and see how it works:</p>
    <p><code>/dth register -u lmao-b -p uplay -n alexanderdth</code></p>
    <p><img src="image-19.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>13. Removing your profile / Unregistering</h3>
    <p><code>/dth unregister -u &lt;insert-username&gt; -p &lt;insert-platform&gt;</code> will allow you to wipe your
        data.
        Simple and effective. It's the opposite of the command found above. Follow the same logic.</p>
    <p><img src="image-20.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>14. Me</h3>
    <p><code>/dth me</code> is a command which pulls your account information based on a profile you created using the
        above
        steps. So, you have to have a profile registered for this to work.</p>
    <p><img src="image-21.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>15. Track</h3>
    <p><code>/dth track &lt;insert-username-here&gt;</code> is without a doubt the most popular command. It pulls data
        straight from Ubisoft's servers, passes it through our algorithms, saves it and then finally, serves it to you.
    </p>
    <p><img src="image-22.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>16. Search</h3>
    <p><code>/dth search &lt;insert-keyword&gt;</code> is basically ISAC's own version of Google. Since ISAC stores it's
        data in a database, it makes it possible for users to search for it. This is useful in case you do not remember
        a
        name, you're lazy or you simply want to explore what you can find. It requires a simple keyword. Contrary to
        <code>/dth track &lt;insert-username-here&gt;</code>, it does not require the EXACT username, instead, you
        provide
        it with a keyword. Example:
    </p>
    <p><img src="image-23.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>There is an additional parameter which you can send it, <code>--legacy</code>. ISAC has a built-in method from
        grabbing older usernames. Some proviles have something listed on them that reads
        <code>Legacy / Pre-ISAC Usernames</code>. This is essentially a list of really old names auto-grabbed. You can
        &quot;force&quot; ISAC to search the database, based on these names.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-24.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>17. Playstation / XBOX Tracking</h3>
    <p>We do support consoles to some extend, hence we have 2 endpoints to use for consoles. They are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth psn track &lt;insert-username-here&gt;</code></li>
        <li><code>/dth xbox track &lt;insert-username-here&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Keep in mind, since xbox contains usernames with spaces, you will have to encapsulate your username in between
        &quot;&quot;. In other words:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth xbox track &quot;i am player 123&quot;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>18. History</h3>
    <p><code>/dth history</code> is a command which allows you to keep track of who you searched for. It's a feature
        that is
        not widely used, but know this, it's there. You may also specify the optional paramter <code>console</code>, in
        order to pull information.</p>
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In DM (Listing global searches):</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-29.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p><img src="image-26.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a server (Lists searches from THAT server):</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-27.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p><img src="image-28.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>19. Watchlist</h3>
    <p><code>/dth watchlist</code> is another obscure, but very powerful command. It's purpose is simple: store players
        on
        your personal watchlist. It's like your personal storage space. If you got people you want to keep an eye on,
        drop
        them in the watchlist.</p>
    <p><img src="image-30.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>You got a limit of 40 usernames you can store on your watchlist. It's usage is very simple:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>-a &lt;insert-username&gt;</code>, adds a player</li>
        <li><code>-rm &lt;insert-username&gt;</code>, removes a player</li>
        <li><code>-all</code>, lists your players</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, let's give it a try, let's add a player:</p>
    <p><img src="image-31.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Let's list our items:</p>
    <p><img src="image-32.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Finally, let's wipe a record:</p>
    <p><img src="image-33.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>As you can see, the functionality is very easy to use. The information displayed includes</p>
    <ul>
        <li>current username</li>
        <li>username history</li>
        <li>player merits alongside cheater status.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>20. Report</h3>
    <p><code>/dth report</code> is the command you want to use, if you want to send us evidence. It requires a few
        parameters, but we'll walk you through it. Go ahead and run <code>/dth report help</code>.</p>
    <p><img src="image-34.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>The paramters required for running this command:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>-u &lt;insert-username&gt;</code>, provide the username</li>
        <li><code>-l &lt;insert-proof&gt;</code>, provide the proof. Put your input in between &quot;&quot;, if you got
            multiple links to send</li>
        <li><code>-d &lt;insert-description&gt;</code>, provide the description. Put it in between &quot;&quot;, if you
            want
            to send multiple words</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, lyour input should look like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth report -u lmao-b -l &quot;youtube1 youtube2 youtube3&quot; -d &quot;this user is cheating his ass off&quot;</code>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also find the full example when checking the command helper.</p>
    <h3>21. Vendor Reset</h3>
    <p><code>/dth vendors</code> is a really cool and useful commands. It uses data provided by RubemAlamina.mx in order
        to
        perform vendor listing and searching. The command is very rich in features so pay attention.
        Let's run it: <code>/dth vendors help</code>. This will display the helper that you see bellow:</p>
    <p><img src="image-35.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Don't be scared, I know it looks overwhelming, but once you use it a few times, it will feel like nothing.</p>
    <p>There are multiple subcomands that you can use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors must-buy</code> -&gt; This will return items that ISAC deems important. This includes:
            All
            exotics, All DZ Exclusives and All Named Items</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we can dive into vendor locations, these vendor locations have 3 gear categories:
        gear, weapons and mods.</p>
    <p>Logically, it looks something like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors &lt;vendor-location&gt; &lt;gear-type&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vendor locations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>whitehouse</li>
        <li>countdown</li>
        <li>theater</li>
        <li>campus</li>
        <li>haven</li>
        <li>benitez</li>
        <li>dz-south</li>
        <li>dz-west</li>
        <li>dz-east</li>
        <li>cassie</li>
        <li>clan</li>
        <li>castle</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ger Types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>mods</li>
        <li>gear</li>
        <li>weapons</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, let's combine a random location with some random gear type. Say, we wanna see what gear is to sale at the
        castle
        vendor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors castle gear</code> -&gt; In this example we replaced <code>&lt;vendor-location&gt;</code>
            with <code>castle</code> and <code>&lt;gear-type&gt;</code> with <code>gear</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-36.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Let's see what weapons are found at the whitehouse vendor:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors whitehouse weapons</code> -&gt; Same as above, we replaced the location and the gear
            type.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-37.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>We know how annoying expertise and optimization can be, for that, we can also filter by item slot:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors slot &lt;insert-slot-here&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Valid slots:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>backpack</li>
        <li>chest</li>
        <li>kneepads</li>
        <li>mask</li>
        <li>gloves</li>
        <li>holster</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's put it to the test, let's try to find some gloves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors slot gloves</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-41.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Now we can move on to <code>vendor searching</code>. It's sort of like Google, but for vendors. Vendor searching
        searches by <code>gear / weapon name</code> AND NOT BY <code>brand</code> or <code>TYPE</code> or
        <code>SLOT</code>.
        We got commands for these as well. The command looks like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors search &lt;insert-keyword&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's search for EveryDay Carrier:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors search everyday</code></li>
        <li><code>/dth vendors search &quot;everyday carrier&quot;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-38.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Let's find a weapon:</p>
    <p><img src="image-39.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>We can also search for weapons / gear that have some talent you need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors talent &lt;insert-talent-name&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Say I want to find something with &quot;efficient&quot; on. No problem:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors talent efficient</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-40.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Brands you say? Say no more, we got it as well. If you wish to find gear that belongs to a certain brand. The
        command
        looks like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors brand &lt;insert-brand-here&gt;</code> -&gt; The requested parameter can be a simple
            keyword
            such as <code>badger</code> or the full thing: <code>badger tuff</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's give it a try:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors brand &quot;badger tuff&quot;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-42.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Say I want Fenris, now:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors brand fenris</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-43.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Quite easy. Now we land to our last category: <code>mods</code>. The command is simple and it requires just a
        keyword:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors mods &lt;insert-keyword&gt;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, say I need some skill haste mods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors mods &quot;skill haste&quot;</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-44.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <p>Let's see if there are some pulse mods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>/dth vendors mods pulse</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="image-45.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
    <h3>22. Ubisoft Report</h3>
    <p><code>/dth ubisoft-report &lt;insert-cheater-here&gt;</code>, is a command that came later this year. It's
        purpose is
        to use the data we have on cheater and submit it directly to Ubisoft. Basically, you do not have to login to
        Ubisoft, create a ticket, paste data, write stuff and so on. It does it for you in 2 seconds.</p>
    <p>The conditions for this are simple:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Player must be a confirmed cheater in ISAC 2.0</li>
        <li>Player must have evidence linked to their profile</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Let's put it to the test:</p>
    <p><img src="image-46.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
